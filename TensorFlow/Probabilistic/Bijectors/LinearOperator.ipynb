        "You have now seen how bijectors can be used to transform tensors and tensor spaces. Until now, you've only seen this in the scalar case, where the bijector acts on a single value. When the tensors you fed into the bijectors had multiple components, the bijector acted on each component individually by applying batch operations to scalar values. For probability distributions, this corresponds to a scalar event space.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, bijectors can also act on higher-dimensional space. You've seen, for example, the multivariate normal distribution, for which samples are tensors with more than one component. You'll need higher-dimensional bijectors to work with such distributions. In this reading, you'll see how bijectors can be used to generalise scale transformations to higher dimensions. You'll also see the `LinearOperator` class, which you can use to construct highly general scale bijectors. In this reading, you'll walk through the code, and we'll use figure examples to demonstrate these transformations.\n",

        "As you've seen before, it's important to be very careful with shapes in TensorFlow Probability. That's because there are three possible components to a shape: the event shape (dimensionality of the random variable), sample shape (dimensionality of the samples drawn) and batch shape (multiple distributions can be considered in one object). This subtlety is especially important for bijectors, but can be harnassed to make powerful, and very computationally efficient, transformations of spaces. Let's examine this a little bit in this section.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous examples, we applied a bijector to a two-dimensional data point $\\mathbf{x}$ to create a two-dimensional data point $\\mathbf{y}$. This was done using $\\mathbf{y} = B \\mathbf{x}$ where $B$ is the $2 \\times 2$ matrix that represents the scale bijector. This is simply matrix multiplication. To implement this, we created a tensor `x` with `x.shape == [2]` and a bijector using a matrix of shape `B.shape == [2, 2]`. This generalises straightforwardly to higher dimensions: if $\\mathbf{x}$ is $n$-dimensional, the bijection matrix must be of shape $n \\times n$ for some $n>0$. In this case, $\\mathbf{y}$ is $n$-dimensional.\n",
        "\n",
        "But what if you wanted to apply the same bijection to ten $\\mathbf{x}$ values at once? You can then arrange all these samples into a single tensor `x` with `x.shape == [10, 2]` and create a bijector as usual, with a matrix of shape `B.shape == [2, 2]`."

        "In this reading, you saw how to construct scale bijectors in two dimensions using the various `ScaleMatvec` classes. You also had a quick introduction to the general `LinearOperators` class and some of its subclasses. Finally, you saw how batching makes large computations clean and efficient. Be careful to keep track of the tensor shapes, as broadcasting and the difference between batch shapes and event shapes makes errors easy. Finally, note that these bijectors are still amenable to composition (via `Chain` or simply feeding one into another) and inversion, which retains the same syntax you're used to. Enjoy using this powerful tool!"
